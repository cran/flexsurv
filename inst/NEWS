Version 0.3 (2014-01-19)
------------------------

* CRAN release. Includes changes from 0.2.1 to 0.2.3.


Version 0.2.3 (2013-10-09)
-------------------------

* R-forge only release.

* Parameters other than the location parameter can now have covariates
  on them in flexsurvreg.  Thanks to Milan Bouchet-Valat for help with
  this.

* subset and na.action arguments in flexsurvreg and flexsurvspline.

* coef, vcov and confint methods for all fitted model objects.

* Distribution functions for generalized gamma, generalized F, and
  Gompertz, now allow all parameters to be vectorised.

* Bug fix in analytic derivatives for Weibull.

* Restored print output introduced in 0.1.2 which had been
  accidentally removed in 0.1.5.


Version 0.2.2 (2013-07-26)
-------------------------

* R-forge only release.

* Case weights supported in flexsurvreg and flexsurvspline.


Version 0.2.1 (2013-07-03)
-------------------------

* R-forge only release.

* Default left truncation times were being set wrongly for
  user-supplied times in summary.flexsurvreg, giving wrong confidence
  intervals.  These now default to 0.

* Confidence intervals set to 1 for t=0 under spline models. Thanks to
  Paul Pynsent.

* dgompertz,dgengamma,dgengamma.orig,dgenf,dgenf.orig fixed to return
  -Inf instead of 0 when density is zero and log=TRUE.  Thanks to Gao
  Zheng.


Version 0.2 (2013-05-13)
-------------------------

* New summary() method for fitted flexsurvreg and flexsurvspline model
  objects gives fitted survival, cumulative hazard or hazard curves,
  with confidence intervals mosly computed by a simulation method.

* This allows plot.flexsurvreg to plot confidence intervals for the
  fitted survival, hazard or cumulative hazard.

* Left-truncated survival observations are supported in flexsurvreg
  and flexsurvspline.

* New psurvspline and dsurvspline functions giving distribution and
  density function for the spline model.

* Analytic derivatives used in optimisation for spline (odds and
  hazard scale, not normal), exponential, Weibull and Gompertz models.

* Default to BFGS optimisation method, which uses derivatives where
  available and should be much faster, instead of Nelder-Mead.

* Work around NaN warnings from spline models presumably due to
  parameters violating implicit constraints.

* If "knots" specified, boundary knots set to min/max of uncensored
  times, not all times, to match results when "k" is specified.
  Thanks to Paul Pynsent.


Version 0.1.5 (2012-08-29)
-------------------------

* Data are now stored in fitted flexsurvreg and flexsurvspline model
  objects, avoiding environment search errors and allowing package
  functions to be called within other functions.  Thanks to Hanna
  Daniel for the report.

* Gompertz documentation clarified for the case when there is a chance
  of living forever.  qgompertz and rgompertz now return Inf in these
  cases, with no warning, instead of NaN.  Thanks to Michael Sweeting.


Version 0.1.4 (2012-03-22)
--------------------------

* maxt argument in plot.flexsurvreg.

* Plots no longer complain if data named "dat".

* Corrected wrong bug fix from Version 0.1.3 for transforming
  parameter estimates in output when fixedpars=TRUE.

* AIC penalty corrected for models with some fixed parameters.

* qgengamma corrected for parameter Q<0.  Thanks to Benn Ackley.


Version 0.1.3 (2012-01-17)
--------------------------

* No longer complains about invalid initial values when there are zero
  survival times.

* Don't transform parameter estimates in output when fixedpars=TRUE.

* Checking functions for distribution utilities don't complain about
  vectorised parameter values.


Version 0.1.2 (2011-11-08)
--------------------------

* Initial CRAN release.

* More features in print output for flexsurvreg and flexsurvspline
  models.


Version 0.1.1 (2011-04-19)
--------------------------

* Fix of drop=FALSE bug in flexsurvspline.inits which caused
  flexsurvspline to fail with single covariates.


Version 0.1 (2011-03-14)
------------------------
Initial release
