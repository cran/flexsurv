\title{Nonparametric estimator of survival from right-truncated, uncensored data}
\usage{
survrtrunc(t, rtrunc, tmax, data = NULL, eps = 0.001, conf.int = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Vector of observed times from an initial event to a final event.}

\item{rtrunc}{Individual-specific right truncation points, so that each
individual's survival time \code{t} would not have been observed if it was
greater than the corresponding element of \code{rtrunc}.   If any of these
are greater than \code{tmax}, then the actual individual-level truncation
point for these individuals is taken to be \code{tmax}.}

\item{tmax}{Maximum possible time to event that could have been observed.}

\item{data}{Data frame to find \code{t} and \code{rtrunc} in.  If not
supplied, these should be in the working environment.}

\item{eps}{Small number that is added to \code{t} before implementing the
time-reversed estimator, to ensure the risk set is consistent between
forward and reverse time scales. It should be just large enough that
\code{t+eps} is not \code{==t}. This should not need changing from the
default of 0.001, unless \code{t} are extremely large or small and the
data are rounded to integer.}

\item{conf.int}{Confidence level, defaulting to 0.95.}
}
\value{
A list with components:

  \code{time} Time points where the estimated survival changes.

  \code{surv} Estimated survival at \code{time}, truncated above at
  \code{tmax}.

  \code{se.surv} Standard error of survival.
  
  \code{std.err} Standard error of -log(survival). Named this way for consistency with \code{survfit}.

  \code{lower} Lower confidence limits for survival.

  \code{upper} Upper confidence limits for survival.
}
\description{
Estimates the survivor function from right-truncated, uncensored data by
reversing time, interpreting the data as left-truncated, applying the
Kaplan-Meier / Lynden-Bell estimator and transforming back.
}
\details{
Note that this does not estimate the untruncated survivor function - instead
it estimates the survivor function truncated above at a time defined by the
maximum possible time that might have been observed in the data.



Define \eqn{X} as the time of the initial event, \eqn{Y} as the time of the
final event, then we wish to determine the distribution of \eqn{T = Y- X}.

Observations are only recorded if \eqn{Y \leq t_{max}}.  Then the
distribution of \eqn{T} in the resulting sample is right-truncated by
\code{rtrunc} \eqn{ = t_{max} - X}.

Equivalently, the distribution of \eqn{t_{max} - T} is left-truncated, since
it is only observed if \eqn{t_{max} - T \geq X}.  Then the standard
Kaplan-Meier type estimator as implemented in
\code{\link[survival]{survfit}} is used (as described by Lynden-Bell, 1971)
and the results transformed back.

This situation might happen in a disease epidemic, where \eqn{X} is the date
of disease onset for an individual, \eqn{Y} is the date of death, and we
wish to estimate the distribution of the time \eqn{T} from onset to death,
given we have only observed people who have died by the date \eqn{t_{max}}.

If the estimated survival is unstable at the highest times, then consider
replacing \code{tmax} by a slightly lower value, then if necessary, removing
individuals with \code{t > tmax}, so that the estimand is changed to the
survivor function truncated over a slightly narrower interval.

\examples{

## simulate some event time data
set.seed(1)
X <- rweibull(100, 2, 10)
T <- rweibull(100, 2, 10)

## truncate above
tmax <- 20
obs <- X + T < tmax
rtrunc <- tmax - X
dat <- data.frame(X, T, rtrunc)[obs,]
sf <-    survrtrunc(T, rtrunc, data=dat, tmax=tmax)
plot(sf, conf.int=TRUE)
## Kaplan-Meier estimate ignoring truncation is biased
sfnaive <- survfit(Surv(T) ~ 1, data=dat)
lines(sfnaive, conf.int=TRUE, lty=2, col="red")

## truncate above the maximum observed time
tmax <- max(X + T) + 10
obs <- X + T < tmax
rtrunc <- tmax - X
dat <- data.frame(X, T, rtrunc)[obs,]
sf <-    survrtrunc(T, rtrunc, data=dat, tmax=tmax)
plot(sf, conf.int=TRUE)
## estimates identical to the standard Kaplan-Meier
sfnaive <- survfit(Surv(T) ~ 1, data=dat)
lines(sfnaive, conf.int=TRUE, lty=2, col="red")
