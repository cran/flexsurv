\title{Simulate censored time-to-event data from a fitted flexsurvreg model}
\usage{
\method{simulate}{flexsurvreg}(
  object,
  nsim = 1,
  seed = NULL,
  newdata = NULL,
  start = NULL,
  censtime = NULL,
  tidy = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object returned by \code{\link{flexsurvreg}}.}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations per row in \code{newdata}.}

\item{seed}{Random number seed. This is returned with the result of this
function, as described in \code{\link{simulate}} for the \code{lm} method.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame defining alternative sets of covariate values to simulate with.
If omitted, this defaults to the data originally used to fit the model.}

\item{start}{Optional left-truncation time or times.  The returned
survival, hazard or cumulative hazard will be conditioned on survival up to
this time.   Predicted times returned with \code{"rmst"}, \code{"mean"}, \code{"median"} or \code{"quantile"}
will be times since time zero, not times since the \code{start} time.

A vector of the same length as \code{t} can be supplied to allow different
truncation times for each prediction time, though this doesn't make sense
in the usual case where this function is used to calculate a predicted
trajectory for a single individual.  This is why the default \code{start}
time was changed for version 0.4 of \pkg{flexsurv} - this was previously a
vector of the start times observed in the data.}

\item{censtime}{A right-censoring time, or vector of times matching the rows
  of \code{newdata}.  If \code{NULL} (the default) then uncensored times to events
are simulated.}

\item{tidy}{If \code{TRUE} then a "tidy" or "long"-format data frame is
  returned, with rows defined by combinations of covariates and simulation
  replicates.  The simulation replicate is indicated in the column named \code{i}.

  If \code{FALSE}, then a data frame is returned with one row per set of
  covariate values, and different columns for different simulation
  replicates.  This is the traditional format for `simulate` methods in base
  R.

  In either case, the simulated time and indicator for whether the time is
  an event time (rather than a time of right-censoring) are returned in
  different columns.}

\item{...}{Other arguments (not currently used).}
}
\value{
A data frame, with format determined by whether \code{tidy} was specified.
