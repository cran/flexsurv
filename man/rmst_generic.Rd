\title{Generic function to find restricted mean survival of a distribution}
\usage{
rmst_generic(pdist, t, start = 0, matargs = NULL, scalarargs = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdist}{Probability distribution function, for example,
\code{\link{pnorm}} for the normal distribution, which must be defined in
the current workspace.  This should accept and return vectorised parameters
and values.  It should also return the correct values for the entire real
line, for example a positive distribution should have \code{pdist(x)==0}
for \eqn{x<0}.}

\item{t}{Vector of times at which rmst is evaluated}

\item{start}{Optional left-truncation time or times.  The returned
restricted mean survival will be conditioned on survival up to
this time.}

\item{matargs}{Character vector giving the elements of \code{...} which
represent vector parameters of the distribution.  Empty by default.  When
vectorised, these will become matrices.  This is used for the arguments
\code{gamma} and \code{knots} in \code{\link{psurvspline}}.}

\item{scalarargs}{Character vector naming scalar arguments of the distribution function that cannot be vectorised.  This is used for the arguments \code{scale} and \code{timescale} in \code{\link{psurvspline}}.}

\item{...}{The remaining arguments define parameters of the distribution
\code{pdist}.  These MUST be named explicitly.}
}
\value{
Vector of restricted mean survival times of the distribution at
\code{p}.
}
\description{
Generic function to find the restricted mean of a distribution, given the
equivalent probability distribution function using numeric integration.
}
\details{
This function is used by default for custom distributions for which an
rmst function is not provided.

This assumes a suitably smooth, continuous distribution.
}
\examples{

rmst_lnorm(500, start=250, meanlog=7.4225, sdlog = 1.1138)
rmst_generic(plnorm, 500, start=250, meanlog=7.4225, sdlog = 1.1138)
# must name the arguments
