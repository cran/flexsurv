\title{Mean times to events from a flexsurvmix model}
\usage{
mean_flexsurvmix(x, newdata = NULL, B = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Fitted model object returned from \code{\link{flexsurvmix}}.}

\item{newdata}{Data frame or list of covariate values.   If omitted for a
model with covariates, a default is used, defined by all combinations of
factors if the only covariates in the model are factors, or all covariate
values of zero if there are any non-factor covariates in the model.}

\item{B}{Number of simulations to use to compute 95\% confidence intervals,
based on the asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of the basic
parameter estimates.  If \code{B=NULL} then intervals are not computed.}
}
\value{
Mean times to next event conditionally on each alternative event,
  given the specified covariate values.
}
\description{
This returns the mean of each event-specific parametric time-to-event
distribution in the mixture model, which is the mean time to event
conditionally on that event being the one that happens.
}
