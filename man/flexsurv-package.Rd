flexsurv: Flexible parametric models for time-to-event data
}
\description{
  flexsurv: Flexible parametric models for time-to-event data,
  including the generalized gamma, the generalized F and the
  Royston-Parmar spline model.
}
\details{

  \code{\link{flexsurvreg}} fits parametric models for time-to-event
  (survival) data.  Data may be right-censored or left-truncated.
  Several built-in parametric distributions are available.  Any
  user-defined parametric model can also be employed by supplying a list
  with basic information about the distribution, including the density
  and probability functions.

  Covariates are included using a linear model on a location parameter of
  the distribution.  This usually defines an accelerated failure time or
  proportional hazards model, depending on the distribution and parameter.

  \code{\link{flexsurvspline}} fits the flexible survival model of
  Royston and Parmar (2002) in which the log cumulative hazard is
  modelled as a natural cubic spline function of log time, including a
  linear term for covariates.  Alternative proportional odds or probit
  parameterisations are available.

  Output from the models can be presented as survivor, cumulative
  hazard and hazard functions (\code{\link{summary.flexsurvreg}}).
  These can be plotted against nonparametric estimates
  (\code{\link{plot.flexsurvreg}}) to assess goodness-of-fit.

  Distribution (``dpqr'') functions for the generalized gamma and F distributions are
  given in \code{\link{GenGamma}}, \code{\link{GenF}} (preferred
  parameterisations) and \code{\link{GenGamma.orig}},
  \code{\link{GenF.orig}} (original parameterisations).

  \code{\link{flexsurv}} also includes the standard Gompertz distribution
  with unrestricted shape parameter, see \code{\link{Gompertz}}.

\section{Related R packages}{
  \code{\link{flexsurv}} was written to encourage the use of flexible
  distributions to account for model uncertainty in survival analysis,
  initially the three-parameter generalized gamma, four-parameter
  generalized F and the Royston-Parmar spline
  model. However it was straightforward to modularise the design of the
  code to accept any generic parametric distribution.

  \code{\link[survival]{survreg}} from the \pkg{survival} package, the
  recommended R package for survival analysis, supports two-parameter
  location-scale parametric models.

  The \pkg{eha} package includes functions \code{\link[eha]{phreg}} and
  \code{\link[eha]{aftreg}} for parametric survival modelling under a
  variety of distributions and proportional hazards or accelerated
  failure time parameterisations.

  Other facilities for generic maximum likelihood model fitting exist,
  for example \code{\link[MASS]{fitdistr}} in the \pkg{MASS} package.
  \code{\link{flexsurvreg}} is intended to provide typical outputs and
  summaries of interest to survival analysts, particularly in medical
  applications.  Feature requests along these lines are welcome.

  Note that if an R package provides density and probability functions
  for a parametric distribution, it can then be used easily in
  \code{\link{flexsurvreg}}.  For instance, several ``reliability''
  distributions used in industrial statistics are available in the
  \pkg{VGAM} package.  Please report unexplained inconsistencies in
  results between \pkg{flexsurv} and other software.
